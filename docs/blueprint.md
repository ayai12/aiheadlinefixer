## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Electric Blue (#0066FF) for CTAs and highlights, to suggest the future-facing feel of AI.
- Background color: Very light blue-gray (#F7F7F7), close in hue to the primary but desaturated and bright to create a neutral background.
- Accent color: Bright Yellow (#FFDD00) for secondary accents, based on a hue approximately 30 degrees to the 'left' of the primary color (electric blue) in the color wheel.
- Headings: 'Poppins' (geometric sans-serif) for bold and punchy headlines.
- Body: 'PT Sans' (humanist sans-serif) for clean and readable text.
- Use a sleek, SaaS-style UI with a focus on conversion. Landing page should feel premium and professional.
- Subtle fade-in when results load and hover animations for buttons and cards to create a dynamic user experience.
